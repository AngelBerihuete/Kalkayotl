As you may already know, in the Bayesian formalism, to estimate the posterior distribution a prior is required. These later, fromally is a probability distribution function on the parameters. However, since the posterior is noramlised by the evidence, the prior can be an improper one. Nevertheless, the prior implemented (so far) in p2d, are all of them probability distribution functions.

As you also may know, the prior is intended to probide whatever *a priori* information that you might have concerning the distribution of parameter values. Some times, this *a priori* information is negligible or even null. In the particular case of distance estimation, this *a priori* information is not null. 

We know *a priori* that there are no negative distances. This very simple and even obvious information has already reduced to halve the search space! ([0,+infinity) instad of (-infitity,+infitnity)). Another useful *a priori* information is the finite scale distance of our problem. For practical cases, our distance inference has an upper limit, that of the observable universe. In most of the practical cases of distance determination, we have a rough idea of the upper limit of our search (e.g. the solar system, the solar neighbourhood, the galaxy or the local group). This very simple lower and upper limits can be used to set a :ref:`Uniform` prior.

If we are in posession of more *a priori* information on the actual distribution of distances, we can set more complex priors. In the p2d, we provide at least three more priors which convey different degrees of information. These are given by the following distributions: :ref:`Gaussian`, :ref:`Cauchy`, and the exponentially decreasing one provided by Bailer-Jones 2015 (called :ref:`EDBJ2015` for simplicity).
